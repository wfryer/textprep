ABOUT
This is a web-based "Social Media Text Prepper" which creates numerically sequential, character-limited threads to post on different social media platforms including Mastodon, Threads, Blue Sky, and more.

These three files (html, CSS and javascript) need to be uploaded to the same file directory on a web hosting account.

TO USE:
1- Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2- Either type or copy/paste a series of sentences and links you want to share on social media into the text box.
3- Click the checkboxes for additional hashtags you want to append to the end of your post.
4- Type any additional hashtags you want to use in provided text boxes.
5- Tap the social media platform (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, K12Leaders, Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, X) you want to use.
6- Copy/Paste each thread into your social media app and post, replying to the previous post to create a "thread" of your post.
